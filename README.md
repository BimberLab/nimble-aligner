# nimble-aligner

**nimble should be installed and used via the [Python CLI](https://github.com/BimberLab/nimble).**

nimble-aligner contains the core alignment code that powers nimble, a tool for generating supplemental counts with RNA-seq/scRNA-seq data on customizable reference genomes. While this repo can be compiled and ran by itself, the CLI frontend provides ease of installation, multi-platform support, and routines for creating custom genomes, among other use-cases.
