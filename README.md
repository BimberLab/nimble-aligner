# nimble-aligner
**nimble-aligner should be installed and used via its [Python cli package](https://github.com/BimberLab/nimble).**

nimble-aligner is the backend for nimble, a tool that executes lightweight, flexible alignments to generate supplemental alignment data. nimble-aligner uses pseudoalignment in order to rapidly generate supplemental calls via [rust-pseudoaligner](https://github.com/10XGenomics/rust-pseudoaligner/tree/master/src).
